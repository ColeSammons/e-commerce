  Simply download or clone into a directory. Node is a prerequisite along with MySQL. Once installed run 'npm install'. Log into your SQL shell and create a database with 'source db/schema.sql'. Type 'USE ecommerce_db;' and exit the shell. From there 'npm run seeds' and when you're ready to start the server use 'npm start'.
